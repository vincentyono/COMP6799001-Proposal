      <h2>Project Details</h2>
      <h3>Project Name: Primal Games (Online Video Game Store)</h3>
      <h3>Team Members:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Justin Theofilus Yonathan</li>
        <li>Peter Nelson Subrata</li>
        <li>Vincent Yono</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
      <p>
        Gaming is a huge industry nowadays and companies have made billions in
        profit selling digital copies of games through their own marketplace. We
        propose to build a complete system with a database and application for
        the user using SQL and react native.
      </p>

        alt="steam logo"
      />

      <p>
        The application will be similar to Steam or Google Play Store, users
        will be able to browse through our game collections, and then they will
        also be able to purchase and download if it is to their liking.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our application will be specialized for mobile devices, and we will
        implement it using React Native as our front-end, NestJS as our back-end
        (REST API), and PostgreSQL as our database
      </p>

      <h3>Target User</h3>
      <p>Our main audience will be mobile users who enjoy games</p>

      <h3>Administrator</h3>
      <p>
        we will try our best to maintain the database in a well enough
        condition. If a transaction fails to occur or any problems that are not
        the fault of the user happens, we will try to work on the problem as
        soon as possible.
